## Making Custom Reporters

If your favorite diff tool isn't already in ApprovalTests. There are a couple ways you can fix that. First, try a custom reporter

<!-- snippet: custom_reporter -->
```cs
internal class CustomReporter : GenericDiffReporter
{
    // Allows performance optimizations
    public static readonly CustomReporter INSTANCE = new CustomReporter();

    public CustomReporter() :
        base(@"c:\path\to\application.exe")
    {
    }

}
```

If you have more details you might want to use the DiffInfo Class.

<!-- snippet: custom_reporter_diff_info -->
```cs
public CustomReporter() :
    base(
        new DiffInfo(
            @"c:\path\to\application.exe",
            "--nosplash {0} {1}",
            DiffPrograms.TEXT_AND_IMAGE))
{
}
```

## Disposables.Create

`using` statements nicely cleanup on exit if you have a `IDisposable` or you can create a simple disposable object by passing in a lambda.  

<!-- snippet: disposables -->
```cs
using (var cleanup = Disposables.Create(() => callCount++))
{
    //code
}
```
